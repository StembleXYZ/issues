# Stemble's official Issues repository
Hey fellow coder! You are probably thinking what the need for this repository was. This repository is **essential for our platform**.

Your feedback is vital to the development of Stemble. Whether it's a bug that's f**king up the UI, or a suggestion that could drastically improve user experience of the platform OR perhaps a new feature that you guys would have in mind.

We want our platform to be **community-driven**!

If you have a query regarding the platform, you can mail us at: onstemble@gmail.com
Although it's better if you join our Discord server and ask us there: https://stemble.xyz/invite

**Keep learning and building with Stemble!** ðŸ§ ðŸš€
